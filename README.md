# Python_Challenge

The PyBank challenge involved reading a file with profit and loss statements of a bank to identify the number of months in the dataset, the total profit gained or lost, the average change in difference between months, and finally the greatest increase and decrease in profit/loss in a given month.

The PyPoll challenge involved reading another file of data which includes the votes of an election. The challenge was to identify the number of votes for each candidate, identify the percentage of votes received by each candidate, and identifying the winner of the election.
